### Calculator

Create a user interface where the user can input two values (2 input elements) and the select type of mathematical operation. When the submit (`=` button) is clicked, capture this input, bundle it up in an object, and send this object to the server via a POST. There should also be a 'C' button that will clear the user input fields.

HTML:
<!-- Add H1 for "Server Side Calculator"
For Inputs:
Add One Input Element Before
Add Button for Addition
Add Button for Subtraction
Add Button for Multiplication
Add Button for Division
One Input Element After Calculation Buttons
Add Button for Running The Equation
Add a Clear button with just the Letter C -->

<!-- Add a Div for the Output
Add a Div for the history -->

Javascript Client.JS
Add Event Listeners for:

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Equals - This is our "submit"
* Clear

The object we are passing to the server Equation 

EquationToInput = {
        Input 1 : 
        Operator: "Division"
        Input 2:
}
.number

<!-- On the server 
Equation(EquationnToInput.input1) + (EquationnToInput.Operator) + (EquationnToInput.Input2:) -->

4 Seperate Operators?
if (Operator = "/")
    EquationnToInput.Operator[0] / EquationnToInput.Operator [2]

History = []

Write the Function that takes in the event. (button click)
    Does it need to be complicated? Or Does it Just package the input together?
    Input can be packaged as an object (object will help us conceptualize)
    Function should package input numbers together it does NOT run the calculation

Set Up AJAX Get and POST Functions to the server
    (Determine if more than one is needed)
    POST will be nested inside of the click event listener function
    GET Function will append to the DOM
    Test one variable to see if it is going to go through

Serve Side Function:
    POST: Input 1 + Whatever the operation is + input 2
    GET: Output to client.js so that it can be appended to the DOM
    Wait to figure out the guts of this


### History

Keep a historical record of all math operations and solutions on the server.
Display a list of all previous calculations on the page when it loads using a GET request. 
Update the list when a new calculation is made.

    Create an Variable with an Empty array to hold the history
    On the server.js file Push() the history as an object  -Into and Array
    Figure out way to display that information on the DOM
        Is this another part of the POST/GET function?

Testing:
Make sure that you console log as you are building the seperate functions
Start with maybe one input first to make sure it gets all the way through the server and appends to the DOM


Build out the server-side logic to compute the numbers as appropriate.
The server should be able to handle Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. 
Once the calculation is complete, send back the OK. (dont forget the send function at the bottom of the POST
You should do a GET request after the POST to get the actual calculation.

This I still need to do:
Add functionality to all operator buttons
    Add true falls swtich for each button
Add functonality to the equals sign that    switches all of the buttons to false
Add functionality to the clear button to clear the history


> NOTE: History should exist even after refreshing the page. It's expected that the history will go away after restarting the server. We'll talk about long term data storage next week.
